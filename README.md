# Shiny
Practica shiny

As part of my R essay for Data Visualisation subject,  I have created a Shiny App to play with MNIST database.

The app uses this database, randomly picking a number from it and showing the image when the users starts the game. He/she have to guess the real number of the picture. 

The user is able to add different noises to the image and keep playing as much as he/she wants.

Enjoy the game
